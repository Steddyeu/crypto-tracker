# This project
This project is a live cryptocurrency tracker making get request from CoinGeckos api. Link: https://www.coingecko.com/en/api

I have used axios to make the get requests and this is my first project using react-hooks.

The table gives live updates, on cryptocurrencies and highlights if they have gone up or down in the past 24hrs. It gives the value and total market cap of the coins.

Within the next week i intend to add a newsfeed to the page where in conjunction with searching for a coin, it will bring all related news articles connected to the said coin.

# Cowellereum
I have also added a link to my node.js project cowellereum in which i make my own (very very basic) cryptocurrency.

# Planned improvements 
Top movers table. Trending news feed. List of crypto events, filtered down to local area. Charts showing performance grpahs of each coin.
